Excited to share our new preprint: **"Stoichiometric analysis of microbial communities: interrelating community function, structure and biomass carrying capacity"** (Bruggeman FJ, Paez-Watson T, Teusink B, Kleerebezem R; 2025).

We present a steady-state stoichiometric framework that links macrochemical equations, growth/death rates, and ATP yields to predict **relative species abundances**, the **community conversion** (net macrochemical reaction), and the **biomass carrying capacity**. The paper includes a worked yeast-acetobacter cross-feeding example, a matrix formulation for larger consortia, and notes on maintenance energy and living vs dead biomass fractions.
