Our latest work on developing methods to assess the energy metabolites of complex microbial communities is out!<br>
We show how the adenylate pool (ATP, ADP, AMP) of a whole community changes under dynamic conditions. These measurements can help constrain thermodynamic analyses and pinpoint the causes of phenotypic shifts; nicely linking back to our modeling framework.
