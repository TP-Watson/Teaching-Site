I will be teaching in the **Advanced Course** at Biotech Delft:  
**Integrated Multi-Omics Approaches for Improvement of Industrial Microbes.**

Course link:  
<https://biotechdelft.com/courses/integrated-multi-omics-approaches-for-improvement-of-industrial-microbes/#downloads>

I will cover **resource allocation** and its implementations in **metabolic networks**.  
The slides and exercises will be available on my **Materials** page:
[Materials]({{ '/materials/' | relative_url }})
