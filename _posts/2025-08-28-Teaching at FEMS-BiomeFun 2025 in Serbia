Just came back from a week in Serbia for the **FEMS-BiomeFun 2025** course.  
It was a mix of emotions and learnings: I taught a full day, starting from the **basics of Python**, moving into **ecological models**, and finishing with **metabolic modelling using COBRA**.  

It was tough, but students really appreciated it. Beyond the science and the teaching, the **multicultural background** of all participants made the experience so enriching and inspiring. One of the highlights of my career; and a reminder of why I love to teach.
