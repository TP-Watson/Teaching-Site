# BiomeFUN_2025 
## Advanced course in Serbia

In this course, I introduced two types of models that can be useful to examine microbial communities, with concepts and practical simple examples. Below you can find the material I used for this course.

# Analysis of Metabolic Networks (readers)
## MSc Life Sciences and Technology - TU DELFT

Below you can find the teaching materials for my course in the MSc Life Sciences and Technology program at TU Delft.  
The readers introduce key concepts in metabolic modeling, including mass balances, stoichiometric models, and pathway thermodynamics.
